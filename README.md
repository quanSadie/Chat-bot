# Chat-bot
Chat bot (discord) using Spring boot, discord4j and open AI API, build with microservices architecture.
To communicate between services, I use OpenFeign.
- !todo: show your todos list.
- !todo_add <item> add item into your todos list.
- !todo_done <item> remove item from your todos list.
- ai!ask <message> ask a bot anything and it will response based on the context.

Deployed on Google Cloud Kubernetes (the Todo feature not available for this version).
